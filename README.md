# WARNING: This repo contains *research-grade-code*

### "Research-grade-code" Definition:
Code that potentially worked more or less at least once for me.
The code may or may not work when conditions change slightly (eg. running in a different moon phase).
The code is most likely abandoned and thus will not be maintained by the original author.

Usual advice: proceed with caution
